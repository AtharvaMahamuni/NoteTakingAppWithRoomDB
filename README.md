# NoteTakingAppWithRoomDB

In this note app I have used Android Architecture Component guidlines for best practices as suggested by Android team.
<br/>
This Android [Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin#1) with kotlin for Android Room with a View is proved very useful while building this app. 
<br/>
Used room for handling SQLite for first time and it proved out to be very useful thing.


This is an app to save notes. Here I used room library to work with the SQLite database.
